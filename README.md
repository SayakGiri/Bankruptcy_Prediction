### Software: Python


### Description of features:

##### 1. Inventory/Working Capital: Inventory is part of a company's working capital. Inventory is classified as current assets because it is typically consumed within a year as part of the production process. Inventory incurs warehousing costs and is considered opportunity cost.

##### 2. Retained Earnings to Total Asset: Retained earnings to total assets is a ratio which helps in measuring the profitability of the assets of an entity. It illustrates how much profits over all the years since inception were generated from $1 of total assets.

##### 3. Persistent EPS: Earnings per share (EPS) is a key metric used to determine the common shareholder’s portion of the company’s profit. EPS measures each common share’s profit allocation in relation to the company’s total profit. IFRS uses the term “ordinary shares” to refer to common shares.

##### 4. Net profit before tax/Paid-in capital: Paid in capital is the payments received from investors in exchange for an entity's stock. This is one of the key components of the total equity of a business. Paid in capital can involve either common stock or preferred stock.

##### 5. Borrowing dependency : The dependency ratio is a measure of the number of dependents aged zero to 14 and over the age of 65, compared with the total population aged 15 to 64. This demographic indicator gives insight into the number of people of non-working age, compared with the number of those of working age. 

##### 6. Interest Expense Ratio :  The interest expense ratio is calculated by dividing your business’s total interest expense on all loans for one fiscal or calendar year by the earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation or amortization (commonly referred to as EBITDA).

##### 7. Degree of Financial Leverage(DFL): A degree of financial leverage (DFL) is a leverage ratio that measures the sensitivity of a company’s earnings per share (EPS) to fluctuations in its operating income, as a result of changes in its capital structure. The degree of financial leverage (DFL) measures the percentage change in EPS for a unit change in operating income, also known as earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT).

##### 8. Cash/Total Liability : It measures the portion of a company's assets held in cash or marketable securities.

##### 9. Operating profit per person: Profit per person refers to a metric that evaluates the efficient use of personnel. Profit per person is particularly useful for companies that have a relatively high proportion of labor expenses.

##### 10. Interest Coverage Ratio: The interest coverage ratio is a debt and profitability ratio used to determine how easily a company can pay interest on its outstanding debt.

##### 11. Net worth/assets: Net worth is the value of the assets a person or corporation owns, minus the liabilities they owe. It is an important metric to gauge a company's health, providing a useful snapshot of its current financial position.

##### 12. Equity to liability : The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is used to evaluate a company's financial leverage and is calculated by dividing a company’s total liabilities by its shareholder equity.

##### 13. Net Income to Total Assets : ROA is net income divided by total assets. The ROA is the product of two common ratios: profit margin and asset turnover.

##### 14. Working Capital to Total Assets: The working capital to total assets ratio compares the net liquid assets to the total assets of the firm. Working Capital is the difference between current assets and current liabilities, so the Working Capital to Total Assets ratio determines the short-term company's solvency.

##### 15. Per share net profit before tax(Yuan): In a given fiscal year, a publicly-traded company's profit divided by the number of shares outstanding. In general, earnings per share apply only to common shares. It is calculated thusly: Earnings per share = (net income - preferred dividends) / average shares outstanding.

##### 16. Total income/total expenses : Ratio of total income earned to totla sxpenses made.

##### 17. ROA(B) before interest and depreciation after tax ; After-tax return on assets (ROA) is a financial ratio used to measure after-tax income earned by a company from its assets. After-tax ROA compares after-tax income to average total assets (ATA) and is expressed as a percentage.

##### 18. Continuous interest rate after tax: Compound interest is interest calculated on the initial principal and also on the accumulated interest of previous periods of a deposit or loan. The effect of compound interest depends on frequency. Continuously compounded returns compound the most frequently of all. Continuous compounding is the mathematical limit that compound interest can reach.


### Statistical Techniques:
